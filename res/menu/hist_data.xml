Over 50 rescue workers and residents worked for 12 hours, digging through the snow and the debris to free trapped residents.  In the Outer Battery, another avalanche (caused by the same storm) buried a house that withheld the weight of the snow.  The strong structure protected the residents; however, they were trapped until dug out by rescue workers.  This was the second avalanche to affect The Battery in 40 years.

For example, Saskatoon had less than one-quarter of the usual amount of spring precipitation, making the months of March, April and May the driest since record-keeping began in 1892. It wasn't just spring that was dry. The soil moisture recharge period between September 1, 2008 and March 31, 2009 had less than 60 per cent of normal precipitation. To the west, in Alberta, conditions were even drier, as illustrated by precipitation amounts in Edmonton, where the 12- month total rain and snow from July 2008 to June 2009 was only 234 mm, less than half of normal and the driest such period with records dating back to 1880. Making matters worse, eight of the last ten years in Alberta's capital of Edmonton had less rain and snow than the 30-year average total, but no year was as scanty as the most recent.

Overland flooding from March 24 to May 21 caused by a combination of snowmelt, seasonal precipitation and the spring breakup affected southern Manitoba's watershed areas of the Red, Pembina, Assiniboine, and Souris Rivers.  The event caused flooding of houses and evacuations from communities including Roseau River First Nation, Sioux Falls, Peguis First Nation, St. Andrews, St. Clements and Selkirk.  The flooding also resulted in damage to public infrastructure such as bridges, roads, and highways. Three principal factors led to the spring flooding: 1) Heavy autumn rains, about 43 per cent more than normal, saturated the ground just before freezing in early December, which left little room for absorbing snow melt in the spring; 2) It was a snowy winter in southern Manitoba with some 25 per cent more snowfall than normal. Heavy snowfalls and copious spring rains swelled the critical headwaters of North Dakota sending excessive waters north into Canada via the Red River and its tributaries; and, 3) An unseasonably cold spring slowed basin snow melting, ice decaying in rivers, and overland flow from ditches and culverts."</COMMENTS></Event><Event><EVENT_APP>Flood</EVENT_APP><CATEGORY_RSS>Natural</CATEGORY_RSS><PLACE>Winnipeg MB</PLACE><LATITUDE>49.899754</LATITUDE><LONGITUDE>-97.1375</LONGITUDE><IS_PROVINCE>no</IS_PROVINCE><PROVINCE_NAME/><EVENT_START_DATE>01/01/1923</EVENT_START_DATE><EVENT_END_DATE>01/01/1923</EVENT_END_DATE><COMMENTS>"Winnipeg MB, 1923.

A few days after the landslide occurred, a temporary 2-inch gas line was installed to restore partial service.

This type of landslide took place in very sensitive glaciomarine muds, and is called a retrogressive earthflow.

A storm pushed through New Brunswick during the last week of October. Hydro utilities reported more than 6,000 customers without electricity in New Brunswick and about 2,000 in Nova Scotia before power was restored.  Some Moncton residents faced sewer backups after high winds caused leaves to fall, blocking catch basins. Several streets and homes flooded after 116 mm of rain fell in St. Johns. Firefighters responded to more than 30 calls for flooded basements filled with more than a metre of sewer water. October rainfall in Saint John amounted to 245.4 mm, which was just 2 mm less than the record set in 1977."</COMMENTS></Event><Event><EVENT_APP>Storms and Severe Thunderstorms</EVENT_APP><CATEGORY_RSS>Natural</CATEGORY_RSS><PLACE>Edmonton area AB</PLACE><LATITUDE>53.40858</LATITUDE><LONGITUDE>-113.61703</LONGITUDE><IS_PROVINCE>no</IS_PROVINCE><PROVINCE_NAME/><EVENT_START_DATE>18/07/2009</EVENT_START_DATE><EVENT_END_DATE>18/07/2009</EVENT_END_DATE><COMMENTS>"Edmonton area AB, July 18, 2009.

A supercell storm developed just south of Lake Huron and tracked northeastward for a remarkable 200 km. The heat and humidity hanging over Ontario increased once the clouds disappeared.  At the same time, a squall line developed over Lower Michigan and traveled across Ontario. This system produced straight-line winds from Windsor to northeast of Toronto and destructive tornados in Vaughan and Newmarket. While these tornados were wreaking havoc just north of Toronto, another series of supercell thunderstorms was spawning tornados in portions of Simcoe County, Muskoka and Parry Sound Districts to the east of Georgian Bay, and north towards Lake Nipissing. In total, the day's weather produced 19 confirmed tornadoes, including: four F0, eleven F1, and four F2. That was the greatest number of F2 tornadoes in Ontario in one day since the Barrie/Central Ontario tornadoes of May 31, 1985. It was also a new Canadian record for the most confirmed tornadoes in one day. Violent winds snapped trees, lifted roofs, flattened cars, mowed down fences, collapsed farm buildings, and inflicted property losses around $100 million. The first tornado of the day touched down in the town of Durham in Grey County, killing an 11-year-old boy as he left a nearby conservation area day camp.  About 600 homes, mostly in the communities of Maple and Woodbridge, were damaged. Thirty-eight were demolished and declared unsafe. Major flooding occurred along the lakeshore, and at the peak of the storm Hydro One reported that 69,000 customers had lost power."</COMMENTS></Event><Event><EVENT_APP>Tornado</EVENT_APP><CATEGORY_RSS>Natural</CATEGORY_RSS><PLACE>DÃ©lÃ©age to Mont-Laurier</PLACE><LATITUDE>46.552696</LATITUDE><LONGITUDE>-75.49736</LONGITUDE><IS_PROVINCE>no</IS_PROVINCE><PROVINCE_NAME/><EVENT_START_DATE>04/08/2009</EVENT_START_DATE><EVENT_END_DATE>04/08/2009</EVENT_END_DATE><COMMENTS>"DÃ©lÃ©age to Mont-Laurier, August 4, 2009.

A strong thunderstorm cell moved over the southern portions of Essex County. It spawned 4 tornadoes and a series of damaging wind gusts along an intermittent path of damage about 40 kilometres in length. The most significant damage was done by an F2 tornado which swept through the south end of the town of Leamington, with peak winds between 180 and 240 km/h.  Approximately 4,500 hydro customers were left without power, and 12 homes were deemed unsafe due to damages.  The Red Cross provided an emergency shelter to help in the wake of the disaster."</COMMENTS></Event><Event><EVENT_APP>Tornado</EVENT_APP><CATEGORY_RSS>Natural</CATEGORY_RSS><PLACE>Portage la Prairie MB</PLACE><LATITUDE>50.137634</LATITUDE><LONGITUDE>-98.253174</LONGITUDE><IS_PROVINCE>no</IS_PROVINCE><PROVINCE_NAME/><EVENT_START_DATE>22/06/1922</EVENT_START_DATE><EVENT_END_DATE>22/06/1922</EVENT_END_DATE><COMMENTS>"Portage la Prairie MB, June 22, 1922.
